# Marketing Budget Allocation Problem
  this algorithm gets the best budget allocation for each marketing channel, given the marketing budget, the set of marketing channels, the return-on-investment (ROI) of each channel and a set of constraints
#### Example

```
Enter the marketing budget (in thousands):
>> 100
Enter the number of marketing channels:
>> 4
Enter the name and ROI (in %) of each channel separated by space:
>> TV advertising 8
>> Google 12
>> Twitter 7
>> Facebook 11
Enter the lower (k) and upper bounds (%) of investment in each channel:
(enter x if there is no bound)
>> 2.7 58
>> 20.5 x
>> x 18
>> 10 x

Please wait while running the GAâ€¦

The final marketing budget allocation is:
TV advertising -> 2.7k
Google -> 76.2k
Twitter -> 5.6k
Facebook -> 15.5k
The total profit is 11.457k
